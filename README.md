# Customer Lifetime Value

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric to estimate the value (profit) that a relationship with a customer represents for a business during a specific period of time. Some of the benefits of CLV are Better Marketing, Encourage Brand Loyalty, and Gain More Sales.
The goal of this project is to estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) that can enable the organization to implement future actions to maximize it.
For this implementation, we will use a Buy Till You Die (BTYD) model given by a R package with the same name: BTYD.
